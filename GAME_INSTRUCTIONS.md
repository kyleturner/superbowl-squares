# How To Play

First, you’ll have to figure out what your buy-in is and set a dollar value per square. One dollar works. Five ups the ante. One million is probably a bit too rich.

Collect your cash and then open the unlabeled grid up to participants. If it’s $1 per square, $5 buys you the chance to sign your initials on five different squares on the board, any of which could be winners. At this point, no one knows what their numbers are going to be. Do this until all the squares are filled.

Here’s where things get interesting. Find a random number generator and assign digits 0-9 to the tops of all your columns and the side of each of your rows — i.e., the shaded boxes above. Now, every square should be the intersection of two numbers. Trace that intersection back to its label to figure out the score that pays out.

For example, if your box sits at “5” in the Seahawks rows and “8” in the Patriots column, you’d be a winner for any quarter that ends with the score Kansas City _5 (where the blank is any number because only the last number counts), Philadelphia _8.

If your two numbers reflect the game’s final score, you win your pool — and a big chunk of the money that comes with it. Of course, there are other ways you can spread out the winners. A 14-7 Patriots lead at the end of the first quarter could pay out 25 percent of the pool to whoever had the square where Philadelphia 4 and Kansas City 7 meet. If the score is 31-21 at halftime, whoever has 1 and 1 gets another 25 percent payout.

There’s no limit to the number of ways you can split the pot, so get creative. The more winners there are, the more fun people will have.
